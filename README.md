## Development Methodology
This project was built following a **Structured Commit Strategy** to simulate a real-world software development lifecycle (SDLC). You can view the [Commit History](commits/main) to see the step-by-step progression:

1.  **Structure:** Building the HTML skeleton (Navbar, Hero, Sections).
2.  **Presentation:** Applying CSS variables, layout, and responsiveness.
3.  **Behavior:** Implementing JavaScript for Dark Mode and animations.
